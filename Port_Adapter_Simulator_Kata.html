    <title>Port/Adapter/Simulator Kata</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
    <p>This kata is practice for understanding and applying the concepts of ports, adapters, and simulators to a small program. If you are new to these concepts, I suggest reading
    the background section and the linked references before you start.</p>
    
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    
    <p>Your goal is to modify the starting program - a simple windows forms editor - so that the methods in it are unit testable without directly using the file system. There are
       likely other modifications that you may want to make as well. </p>
    
    <p>Approach it in whatever order you would like. If you'd like some guidance, see the next section.</p>
    
    <h2>Suggested approach</h2>
    
    <p>There are a lot of different orders here that work; I've chosen one that I like. The important concerns are to get a good adapter definition, and try to do as much of the
        transformation through refactoring (resharper if you have it) as possible. </p>

    <il>
        <ol>
			<li>Refactor the file system code into a separate class so that it 
			is contained.</li>
			<li>Create the adapter abstraction on top of it. This is just an 
			interface that the new file system class expresses.</li>
			<li>Figure out what the adapter abstraction should be. Is it 
			convenient for the application to use? Is it at the right level of 
			abstraction? </li>
			<li>Use refactoring to morph the existing abstraction into the one 
			that you want to have. Repeat for each change that you want to make.
			</li>
			<li>Using TDD, create a simulator for the port that you can use for your unit tests.</li>
			<li>Retarget the simulator tests that you just created and run them 
			against the file system adapter. If there are differences in 
			behavior, decide which is correct (simulator or file system 
			adapter), and modify appropriately.</li>
			<li>Bring the object editor code under test&nbsp; by writing tests for each of the methods that deal with the file system</li>
	</ol>

    </il>
	<p>At this point, you have the file system operations abstracted and 
	contained. Use the same approach to deal with the UI.</p>
	<h1>Background on ports, adapters, and simulators</h1>

	<p>This section is a summary of a pretty broad topic, and I&#39;m going to 
	simplify and generalize to keep it simple.</p>
	<p>The concept of &quot;port&quot; comes from 	<a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Cockburn&#39;s 
	Hexagonal Architecture</a>.. Simply speaking, a port is a connection that a 
	program has to something external, something like a database or a user 
	interface. The sample application has two ports - the user interface of the 
	application (which displays data and dispatches user events), and the file 
	system, which can store and retrieve the editor information.</p>
	<p>Based on a program&#39;s usage of a port, we can derive an abstraction that 
	describes how the program uses the port, and then write a concrete adapter 
	that implements that abstraction. Very simply, we could do something like:</p>
	<pre>class FileSystemAdapter: IFileSystem {...}</pre>
	<p>and it will work fine. However, the real power is in the &quot;adapt&quot; part of 
	the adapter; rather than maintaining the abstraction of the underlying 
	service, the abstraction should be expressed using application-level 
	concepts. The adapter should present an interface that is exactly what the 
	program would like it to be. To take a simple example from the UI side, a UI 
	(aka &quot;port&quot;)-level concept might be the user pressing a button, while the 
	application concept might be &quot;SaveRequested&quot;. </p>
	<p>Another way to think about it is that the purpose of the adapter is to 
	encapsulate the real-world details that the program doesn&#39;t really want to 
	care about.</p>
	<p>This is a fairly typical approach to getting a program under test, and, 
	at this point, we can write mocks and merrily go on with our testing. But 
	there are problems with this approach:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Mock code tends to be duplicated in multiple places in the codebase.</li>
		<li>Mock code - even mock code with some complexity - is rarely tested.</li>
		<li>Mocks created with mocking libraries require the developer to learn 
		a new language - the mocking language - and do not generally participate 
		in refactoring the way program code does. </li>
		<li>There is no verification that the behavior of the mock code is a 
		faithful simulation of the real code. </li>
	</ol>
	<p>The way to avoid this issues is a special kind of adapter known as a 
	simulator, which I learned about from<a href="http://arlobelshee.com/mock-free-example-part-2-simulators/"> 
	Arlo Belshee</a>. A simulator is an implementation of an adapter that is 
	designed for unit testing. In our example, it might be a FileSystemSimulator 
	which implements the adapter interface but stores files in memory. </p>
	<p>The simulator is created using TDD, so we know that it works the way that 
	we expect. But the unit tests created are not specific to the simulator, 
	they are specific to the adapter interface. That means we can take the unit 
	tests, run them against all of the adapters (simulators and real adapters), 
	and verify that all the systems have the same behavior. We can then know 
	that the tests that we write using the simulator are using a faithful 
	simulation of the &quot;real adapter&quot;. </p>
	<h1>Evaluation Thoughts</h1>
	<p>This section is definitely full of spoilers, so it&#39;s presented in 
	white-on-white text (highlight it to read) Read this after you have finished 
	the kata.</p>
	<font color="white">
	<ol>
		<li>At what level of abstraction is the storage adapter expressed? I 
		think something like &quot;ObjectStorage&quot; is the right level; what the 
		application cares is that storage is possible and works in a specific 
		way; where the objects are stored is an implementation detail. </li>
		<li>How happy are you with the resulting code that you ended up? Does it 
		seem to be well-factored, etc.?</li>
	</ol>
